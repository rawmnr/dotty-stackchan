"""Perception consumer loops.

Each consumer subscribes to the bus, processes events on its own
schedule, and dispatches outbound effects through a XiaozhiAdminClient
(and where applicable a NarrativeLLMClient). All consumers expose the
same interface:

    class FooConsumer:
        def __init__(self, state: PerceptionState, xiaozhi: ..., **knobs):
            ...
        async def run(self) -> None:
            ...

main.lifespan() instantiates the configured set and launches each via
asyncio.create_task — same lifecycle the bridge uses today, just
externalised.
