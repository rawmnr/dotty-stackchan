// take_photo voice tool — pi-extension port of bridge.py's
// _voice_tool_take_photo. v1 reads the latest cached vision description
// from the dotty-behaviour daemon over loopback HTTP; returns either the
// description (≤30 s old, capped at 300 chars) or a "can't see" string.
//
// Both upstream code paths (the bridge function and the
// dotty-behaviour /api/voice/take_photo route) cap and fall back
// identically — this tool is a thin wrapper that hands the daemon's
// reply back to the agent verbatim.
